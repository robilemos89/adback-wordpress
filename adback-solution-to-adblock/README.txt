== Description ==

## WHAT IS IT?

This plugin lets you monetize the part of your audience unreachable with your classic monetization tools: the adblock users. This plugin offers a solution only for this target. Your normal ads will be shown to the rest of your audience.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?

Automatically display a footer message offering your users the possibility to turn off their adblock or to click on an ad to access the website.

In any case, you monetize your site thanks to the adblocker deactivation (ads on your website are displayed again) or with the click on the ad. Monetization and performance guaranteed!

Access simple statistics:

* Revenues earned
* Number of clicks on the ad
* Number of message display
* Number of blocked pageviews

## PRICING

The solution is free, without subscription or obligation. You’re gaining money every time a user clicks on the ad. NO FEE, ONLY BONUS!

## INSTALLATION

Activate the plugin and let the magic begin. The configuration is automatic and activated instantly on your site.
Available in English and French.

## WANT MORE?

After the plugin activation, you will have to choose to continue with the quick and easy monetization solution or the advanced solution. We highly recommend to continue with the quick monetization solution unless you are a premium and advanced user.
The advanced solution will give you more detailed statistics, advanced message configuration and access to other monetization solutions. To learn more about AdBack, [visit our website](https://landing.adback.co/en/) or [contact us](mailto:support@adback.co).

**Why is AdBack’s solution different from other solutions on the market?**

AdBack proposes a wide and complete range of statistics. Our strength relies on a strong technology, at the cutting edge of innovation and impossible to be blocked by adblockers.

**What is the custom message?**

The custom message is the pop-in appearing on the adblocker users’ screen. The message can be different depending on the user’s profile. You can add deactivation features to it or different alternatives to advertising.
